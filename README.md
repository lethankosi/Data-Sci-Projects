All projects that I have completed using python

Project 1: House Price - Kaggle Competition. I completed this one as part of a Kaggle competition. It is a great introduction to feature engineering. Completing this project definitely improved my skills in improving a model. The final model scored a mean sqaured log error of 0.15079, an improvement from 0.16127.
