# Data-Sci-Projects
All projects that I have completed using python

Project 1: House Price - Kaggle Competition. I completed this one as part of a Kaggle competition. It is a great introduction to feature engineering. Completing this project definitely improved my skills in improving a model. The final model scored a mean sqaured log error of 0.15079, an improvement from 0.16127.

Project 2: Fake vs Real News. A brief analysis to determine whether news articles were real or fake. Several models were tested, namely, Multinomial NB and LinearSVC, testing out the use of Count Vectorizer and TFIDF before applying both models to the data. The Linear SVC outperformed the Multinomial NB algorithm. The entire dataset was used to create the model.
